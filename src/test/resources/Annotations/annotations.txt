PARATEXT TABLE SECTIONHEADER FOOTNOTE

We generated free cash flow of $10.9billion and $14.1 billion for the fiscal years ended Jan. 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.	PARATEXT

Our freecash flow during the current period was principally impacted by our increased investment in inventory,partially offset by an increase in accounts payable.	PARATEXT

Free cash flow is considered a non-GAAP financial measure under the SEC’s rules.	PARATEXT

Management believes, however, that free cash flow, which measures our ability to generate additionalcash from our business operations, is an important financial measure for use in evaluating thecompany’s financial performance.	PARATEXT

Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than asa substitute for, income from continuing operations as a measure of our performance and net cash providedby operating activities as a measure of our liquidity.	PARATEXT

Additionally, our definition of free cash flow is limited, in that it does not representresidual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does notdeduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made forbusiness acquisitions.	PARATEXT

Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that providessupplemental information to our entire statements of cash flows.	PARATEXT

Although other companies report their free cash flow, numerous methods may existfor calculating a company’s free cash flow.	PARATEXT

As a result, the method used by our management to calculatefree cash flow may differ from the methods other companies use to calculate their free cash flow.	PARATEXT

We urge you to understand the methods used by another company to calculate its free cash flow beforecomparing our free cash flow to that of such other company.	PARATEXT

The following table sets forth a reconciliation of free cash flow, a non-GAAP financialmeasure, to net cash provided by operating activities, a GAAP measure, which we believe to be theGAAP financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow, for the fiscal years ended Jan.31, 2011 and 2010, as well as information regarding net cash used in investing activities and net cashused in financing activities in those periods.       5  See notes on page 6.   14  (Amounts in millions) 2011 2010Net cash provided by operating activities 23,643$               26,249$              Payments for property and equipment (12,699)                (12,184)               Free cash flow 10,944$               14,065$               Net cash used in investing activities (12,193)$              (11,620)$             Net cash used in financing activities (12,028)$              (14,191)$             For the Fiscal Years EndedJanuary 31,  Calculation of Return on Investment and Return on Assets Management believes return on investment (“ROI”) is a meaningful metric to sharewith investors because it helps investors assess how effectively Walmart is employing its assets.	PARATEXT TABLE SECTIONHEADER FOOTNOTE

Trends in ROI can fluctuate over time as management balances long-term potential strategic initiativeswith any possible short-term impacts.	PARATEXT

ROI was 19.2 percent and 19.3 percent for the fiscal years ended Jan. 31, 2011 and2010, respectively.	PARATEXT

We define ROI as adjusted operating income (operating income plus interest income,depreciation and amortization and rent expense) for the fiscal year or trailing twelve months dividedby average invested capital during that period.	PARATEXT

We consider average invested capital to be the averageof our beginning and ending total assets of continuing operations plus accumulated depreciation and amortizationless accounts payable and accrued liabilities for that period, plus a rent factor equalto the rent for the fiscal year or trailing twelve months multiplied by a factor of eight.	PARATEXT

ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure under the SEC’s rules.	PARATEXT

We considerreturn on assets (“ROA”) to be the financial measure computed in accordance with GAAP that is themost directly comparable financial measure to ROI as we calculate that financial measure.	PARATEXT

ROIdiffers from ROA (which is income from continuing operations for the fiscal year or trailing twelvemonths divided by average total assets of continuing operations for the period) because ROI: adjustsoperating income to exclude certain expense items and adds interest income; adjusts total assets fromcontinuing operations for the impact of accumulated depreciation and amortization, accounts payable andaccrued liabilities; and incorporates a factor of rent to arrive at total invested capital.	PARATEXT

Although ROI is a standard financial metric, numerous methods exist for calculatinga company’s ROI.	PARATEXT

As a result, the method used by Walmart’s management to calculate ROI may differfrom the methods other companies use to calculate their ROI.	PARATEXT

We urge you to understand the methodsused by another company to calculate its ROI before comparing our ROI to that of such other company.    15  The calculation of ROI along with reconciliation to the calculation of ROA, themost comparable GAAP financial measurement, is as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) 2011 2010As Adjusted5Operating income 25,542$              24,002$            + Interest income 201                    181                  + Depreciation and amortization 7,641                 7,157               + Rent 1,972                 1,808               = Adjusted operating income 35,356$              33,148$            Average total assets of continuing operations(1) 175,400$            166,584$          + Average accumulated depreciation and amortization(1) 43,911               38,359              - Average accounts payable(1) 32,004               29,650              - Average accrued liabilities(1) 18,718               18,423              + Rent * 8 15,776               14,464              = Average invested capital 184,365$            171,334$          Return on investment (ROI) 19.2% 19.3%NumeratorIncome from continuing operations 15,959$              14,962$            DenominatorAverage total assets of continuing operations(1) 175,400$            166,584$          Return on assets (ROA) 9.1% 9.0%2011 2010As Adjusted5 2009As Adjusted5Total assets of continuing operations(2) 180,532$            170,267$          162,901$           Accumulated depreciation and amortization 46,611               41,210             35,508              Accounts payable 33,557               30,451              28,849              Accrued liabilities 18,701               18,734              18,112             CALCULATION OF RETURN ON ASSETS As of January 31,Certain Balance Sheet DataCALCULATION OF RETURN ON INVESTMENTNumeratorDenominator For the Fiscal Years Ended January 31,   (1) The average is based on the addition of the account balance at the end of thecurrent period to the account balance at the end of the prior period and dividing by 2	PARATEXT TABLE FOOTNOTE

Accounting for certain leasesThe company has been engaged in a review of the accounting treatment of leases.	SECTIONHEADER LEGALESE

As part of this ongoing global review, we are assessing our historical application of Accounting Standards Codification("ASC") 840, Leases, regarding lessee involvement in the construction of leased assets.	LEGALESE

In a numberof our leases, payments we make for certain structural components included in the lessor's construction of the leasedassets will result in the company being deemed the owner of the leased assets for accounting purposes.	LEGALESE

Forexample, the company, due to its scale in purchasing certain structural components for stores under development,for some leases, pays for HVAC systems for leased stores to lower the overall cost of the lease.	LEGALESE

As a result,regardless of the significance of the payments, ASC 840 defines those payments as automatic indicators of ownershipand requires us to capitalize the lessor's total project cost on our balance sheet with a corresponding financingobligation.	LEGALESE

Generally, in these situations, the company has not accounted for the total project costs of the lessoras owned assets.1 See additional information at the end of this release regarding non-GAAP financialmeasures.2 13-week period ending Oct. 30, 2015, compared to 13-week period ended Oct. 31, 2014NYSE: WMT August 18, 2015 stock.walmart.com4As our review and assessment is in process, as of the date of this release, we areunable to provide reasonable estimates of the amounts of any error corrections.

However, the primary impactof any cumulative error corrections, which would be non-cash adjustments, could result in a material increaseto our fixed assets and related lease financing obligations on our balance sheets.	LEGALESE

In addition, based onthe nature of these errors, we would not expect that any cumulative error corrections would be material to ourincome statements, although rent expenses would be re-characterized to depreciation and interest expense.	LEGALESE

Reconciliations of and Other Information Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures(Unaudited)The following information provides reconciliations of certain non-GAAP financialmeasures presented in the press release to which this reconciliation is attached to the most directlycomparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accountingprinciples (GAAP).	PARATEXT SECTIONHEADER

The company has provided the non-GAAP financial information presented inthe press release, which is not calculated or presented in accordance with GAAP, as information supplementaland in addition to the financial measures presented in the press release that are calculatedand presented in accordance with GAAP.	PARATEXT

Such non-GAAP financial measures should not be consideredsuperior to, as a substitute for or alternative to, and should be considered in conjunction with theGAAP financial measures presented in the press release.	PARATEXT

The non-GAAP financial measures in thepress release may differ from similar measures used by other companies.	PARATEXT

Calculation of Return on Investment and Return on AssetsManagement believes return on investment (ROI) is a meaningful metric to share withinvestors because it helps investors assess how effectively Walmart is deploying its assets.	PARATEXT SECTIONHEADER

Trendsin ROI can fluctuate over time as management balances long-term potential strategic initiatives withpossible short-term impacts.	PARATEXT

ROI was 16.2 percent and 16.7 percent for the trailing 12 months ended July•31, 2015and 2014, respectively.	PARATEXT

The decline in ROI was primarily due to continued capital investments,as well as our decrease in operating income.	PARATEXT

We define ROI as adjusted operating income (operating income plus interest income,depreciation and amortization, and rent expense) for the trailing 12 months divided by average investedcapital during that period.	PARATEXT

We consider average invested capital to be the average of our beginningand ending total assets, plus average accumulated depreciation and average amortization, less average accountspayable and average accrued liabilities for that period, plus a rent factor equal to the rentfor the fiscal year or trailing 12 months multiplied by a factor of 8.	PARATEXT

When we have discontinued operations, weexclude the impact of the discontinued operations.	PARATEXT

Our calculation of ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure because we calculateROI using financial measures that exclude and include amounts that are included and excludedin the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.	PARATEXT

For example, we exclude the impact of depreciationand amortization from our reported operating income in calculating the numerator ofour calculation of ROI.	PARATEXT

In addition, we include a factor of 8 for rent expense that estimates the hypotheticalcapitalization of our operating leases.	PARATEXT

We consider return on assets (ROA) to be the financial measurecomputed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) that is the mostdirectly comparable financial measure to our calculation of ROI.	PARATEXT

ROI differs from ROA (which is consolidatedincome from continuing operations for the period divided by average total assets of continuingoperations for the period) because ROI: adjusts operating income to exclude certain expense items andadds interest income; adjusts total assets of continuing operations for the impact of accumulateddepreciation and amortization, accounts payable and accrued liabilities; and incorporates a factorof rent to arrive at total invested capital.	PARATEXT

Although ROI is a standard financial metric, numerous methods exist for calculatinga company's ROI.	PARATEXT

As a result, the method used by management to calculate our ROI may differ fromthe methods used by other companies to calculate their ROI.	PARATEXT

We urge you to understand the methods usedby other companies to calculate their ROI before comparing our ROI to that of such othercompanies.12The calculation of ROI, along with a reconciliation to the calculation of ROA, themost comparable GAAP financial measure, is as follows: Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.

PUBINFO PARATEXT TABLE SECTIONHEADER FOOTNOTE

Free cash flow was $5.1 billion and$6.8 billion for the six months ended July•31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.	PARATEXT

The decrease in free cash flowwas due to lower income from continuing operations and the timing of payments.	PARATEXT

Free cash flow is considered a non-GAAP financial measure.	PARATEXT

Management believes,however, that free cash flow, which measures our ability to generate additional cash from our businessoperations, is an important financial measure for use in evaluating the company's financial performance.	PARATEXT

Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, consolidatedincome from continuing operations as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activitiesas a measure of our liquidity.	PARATEXT

Additionally, Walmart's definition of free cash flow is limited, in that it doesnot represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures, due to the fact that the measuredoes not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or paymentsmade for business acquisitions.	PARATEXT

Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as ameasure that provides supplemental information to our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.	PARATEXT

Although other companies report their free cash flow, numerous methods may existfor calculating a company's free cash flow.	PARATEXT

As a result, the method used by Walmart's managementto calculate our free cash flow may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate theirfree cash flow.	PARATEXT

We urge you to understand the methods used by other companies to calculate their freecash flow before comparing our free cash flow to that of such other companies.	PARATEXT

The following table sets forth a reconciliation of free cash flow, a non-GAAP financialmeasure, to net cash provided by operating activities, which we believe to be the GAAP financialmeasure most directly comparable to free cash flow, as well as information regarding net cash used ininvesting activities and net cash used in financing activities.

TABLE SECTIONHEADER LEGALESE FOOTNOTE

We calculate the effect of changes in currency exchange rates as thedifference between current period activity translated using the current period's currency exchangerates, and the comparable prior year period's currency exchange rates.	LEGALESE

Throughout our discussion, we referto the results of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations.	LEGALESE

When we referto constant currency operating results, this means operating results without the impact of the currencyexchange rate fluctuations and without the impact of acquisitions, if any, until the acquisitionsare included in both comparable periods.	LEGALESE
